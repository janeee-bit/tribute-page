          In October 1968, Idahosa officially inaugurated the Church of God
          Mission International, which had started out previously, as a "small
          prayer group". A claim made by Idahosa that he had raised eight
          people from the dead was dropped when challenged by the Advertising
          Standards Authority, who sought evidence that the individuals
          concerned had in fact been dead. He was commissioned into ministry
          in 1971 by Pa Elton and Gordon Lindsey. He was ordained a Bishop in
          1981, and ordained several others, including Bishop David Oyedepo
          of the Living Faith Church Worldwide in 1989.
